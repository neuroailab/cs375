"""
Welcome to CS375! This is the first part of assignment 1 in which we will
setup an experiment to train AlexNet on ImageNet from scratch.
This document will walk you through setting up an experiment using tfutils 
a tool that we have developed to facilitate using tensorflow.
tfutils biggest advantage is that it provides an easy interface for storing
and loading experiments from a mongodb database. It also provides other useful
features such as data providers for reading tfrecord files or simple ways to
parallelize models across GPU's.
The goal of this tutorial is to learn how to setup an experiment that trains
a standard AlexNet on the ImageNet classification task.

By the time you are reading this document you should have setup your working
environment as described in the Wiki of this repository:
    https://github.com/neuroailab/cs375/wiki
If you haven't yet done so please follow the instructions to setup your
environment!

In the following, we will introduce you to some of tfutils' functionality
that you will need to successfully complete this class.
As you can see at the very end of this file, all you need to do to start 
training a model with tfutils is to call
    base.train_from_params(**params)
This function takes a single argument: A dictionary of parameters that describes
    - the model saving ('save_params')
    - the model loading/restoring ('load_params')
    - the training procedure ('train_params')
    - the validation procedure ('validation_params')
    - the optimizer ('optimizer_params')
    - the learning rate policy ('learning_rate_params')
    - and the model definition ('model_params')

So let's get started with configuring our experiment. For this, you will be 
mostly working in the setup_params function. Please scroll down to 
    def setup_params(self):
to continue the tutorial. Get ready for some coding!

Note: Although you will only have to edit a small fraction of the code at the
beginning of the assignment by filling in the blank spaces, you will need to
build on the completed starter code to fully complete the assignment,
We expect that you familiarize yourself with the codebase and learn how to
setup your own experiments taking the assignments as a basis. This code does
not cover all parts of the assignment and only provides a starting point. To
fully complete the assignment significant changes have to be made and new
functions need to be added after filling in the blanks. Also, for your projects
we won't give out any code and you will have to use what you have learned from
your assignments. So please always carefully read through the entire code and
try to understand it. If you have any questions about the code structure,
we will be happy to answer it.

Attention: All sections that need to be changed to complete the starter code
are marked with EDIT!
